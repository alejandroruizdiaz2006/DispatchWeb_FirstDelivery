# DISPATCH FAN PROJECT
## About The Project
This project is a fan-made website dedicated to the video game "Dispatch". It serves as an interactive wiki and information portal about the game's universe, characters, and mechanics.

The Main Page is designed to immerse the user immediately:

- Hero Section: Features a full-width dramatic background with a call-to-action, setting the tense atmosphere of emergency dispatching.

- Character Roster: Dynamically renders character cards from a JSON dataset. The roster is divided into three distinct sections: Team Z, Superhero Dispatch Network, and Villains, allowing users to visualize the different factions of the game.

- Responsive Design: The layout automatically adjusts from a grid view on desktop to a column view on mobile devices using Flexbox and Media Queries.

## Built With
This project was built using the following third-party components and libraries:

- React - The library for web and native user interfaces.

- Vite - Next Generation Frontend Tooling.

- React Leaflet - Used in the Contact page to display the HQ location on an interactive map.

- i18next - For multi-language support (English/Spanish).

- React Router Dom - For client-side navigation.
